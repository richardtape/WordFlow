# WordFlow: Complete Project Specification

## Game Concept

A unique take on the classic word search puzzle where:

-   Players find words in a grid by connecting adjacent letters in any direction
-   Every letter in the grid is used in at least one word
-   Players trace words with their finger, with the ability to backtrack
-   Words must be actual dictionary words (based on Scrabble word list)
-   Multiplayer support for cooperative and competitive gameplay
-   Real-time synchronization for shared puzzle solving

## Core Game Modes

### Single Player Modes

Three difficulty settings with progressive hint systems:

-   **Beginner**: All hints enabled, no time pressure, reveal word hint always available, auto-save enabled
-   **Normal**: Progressive hints (total words at start, word length breakdown at 10%, letter start hints at 35%, letter containment hints at 50%), timer doesn't end game, reveal word hint after 80% completion, auto-save enabled
-   **Hardcore**: No hints, no auto-save, timer can end game if set by puzzle creator

### Multiplayer Modes

#### Cooperative Multiplayer

-   Two players work together on the same puzzle in real-time
-   Shared progress and scoring with individual contribution tracking
-   Real-time synchronization of all actions and discoveries
-   See partner's finger movements during word tracing
-   Host creates room with 6-digit code for easy joining

#### Competitive Multiplayer

-   Two players race to complete identical puzzles
-   Separate progress tracking for each player
-   Optional real-time visibility of opponent's progress
-   Victory conditions: first to find all words or highest score after time limit
-   Easy rematch functionality

### Builder Mode

-   Create custom puzzles with grid sizes from 3x3 to 6x6
-   Option to blank out squares for irregular shapes
-   Real-time word validation and counting with difficulty assessment
-   Option to disable specific words (become bonus words worth extra points)
-   Save drafts locally and submit to server for community use
-   Set optional time limits for competitive play

## Game Interface & Experience

### Single Player Interface

    -   Bottom right: Number of unfound words containing the letter
-   Simple onboarding tutorial and mode selection
-   Auto-save progress (except in Hardcore mode)
-   Sound effects and visual feedback (configurable)

### Multiplayer Interface

    -   Shared grid with real-time partner tracing visibility
    -   Combined score with individual contribution indicators
    -   Player status indicators
-   **Competitive Mode**:
    -   Side-by-side or overlay progress comparison
    -   Real-time opponent status updates (optional)
    -   Victory announcements with detailed score breakdown
    -   Timer display for timed matches
-   **Connection Management**: Visual indicators for connect/disconnect status

### Builder Interface

## Word Rules & Dictionary

-   Based on Scrabble dictionary with tiered classification:
    -   Common words: Required for puzzle completion
    -   Uncommon/rare words: Optional for bonus points if enabled by creator
-   Family-friendly filter to remove offensive words
-   Word length: 3-letter minimum (4 letters default)
-   Maximum word length limited by grid size (up to 36 letters in a 6x6 grid)
-   Word variants (plurals, past tense) count as separate words

## Scoring System

-   Exponential scoring based on word length (8-letter word worth more than twice a 4-letter word)
-   Consecutive valid word bonuses
-   Time-based bonuses (faster completion = higher bonus)
-   Potential bonus for finding disabled/rare words

## Puzzle Content

-   Ship with multiple pre-made puzzles (~25)
-   Daily challenges delivered from server
-   Option to replay completed puzzles
-   Community submissions (vetted before becoming official puzzles)
