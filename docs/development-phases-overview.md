## Key Development Challenges

While the development phases are clearly defined, this section outlines cross-cutting challenges that will require special attention throughout the project lifecycle to ensure a high-quality outcome. These are not blockers, but rather areas that demand thoughtful design and robust implementation beyond the surface-level tasks.

### 1. Game Design & Puzzle Quality

The core of WordFlow is the quality of its puzzles. Ensuring they are consistently fun and fair is a major challenge.

-   **"Every Letter Used" Constraint**: Guaranteeing this rule for custom-built puzzles in Builder Mode requires a sophisticated graph-based validation engine. This is computationally complex and must be efficient enough to run on-device in real-time.
-   **Defining a "Good" Puzzle**: Beyond being technically solvable, puzzles must have a good "flow." We will need to develop more nuanced quality metrics than just word count and length to avoid frustrating or uninteresting puzzle configurations.
-   **Dictionary Scope & Nuance**: Migrating to a comprehensive Scrabble dictionary will introduce challenges in app size, memory management, and loading times. We will also need to address the complexities of a robust family-friendly filter and handling word ambiguities (e.g., homographs).

### 2. Technical & Performance Hurdles

Meeting the high-performance goals (60fps, low latency) specified in the PRD presents several technical hurdles.

-   **Gesture Recognition Precision**: The "fat finger problem" on dense grids requires more than simple coordinate mapping. We will need to implement forgiving, UX-focused gesture interpretation logic to correctly infer the user's intended path, especially during fast movements near square boundaries.
-   **Real-time Calculation Cascade**: Finding a single word triggers a cascade of state updates (scoring, progress, hint recalculation for the entire grid, letter fading). Performing this entire sequence within a single frame without causing stuttering is a significant performance challenge that will require careful optimization and background processing.
-   **State Management at Scale**: The `GameViewModel` is at risk of becoming a "Massive ViewModel." We must proactively architect our state management to be modular, separating concerns into smaller, focused controllers (e.g., for hints, timers, game state) to maintain testability and clarity.

### 3. User Experience & Interface Nuances

Subtle UX issues can significantly impact the game's polish and user enjoyment.

-   **Visual Clarity of Complex Paths**: Word paths that cross over themselves can become visually confusing "spider webs." We will need to design a path rendering system that clearly shows the order and direction of the trace.
-   **Graceful Handling of Interruptions**: The app must handle system interruptions (like a phone call) at any point—even mid-gesture—and restore the user's state perfectly upon return. This is critical for a high-quality mobile experience.
-   **Truly Adaptive UI**: Beyond simple scaling, we should design layouts that fundamentally adapt to different screen sizes and orientations (e.g., showing the word list side-by-side with the grid on an iPad in landscape).
